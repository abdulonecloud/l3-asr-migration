Steps for migration
---------------------
0. Backup existing neutron database.

1. Create the following tables in neutron database:

cisco_hosting_devices
cisco_phy_router_port_bindings
cisco_phy_routers
cisco_port_mappings
cisco_router_mappings

Use the create_tables.sql

2. Populate the cisco_phy_routers table based on the ASR config

3. Add an entry to the routers table with id=name='PHYSICAL_GLOBAL_ROUTER_ID'

4. For each external_network add gateway and ha_gateway ports for PHYSICAL_GLOBAL_ROUTER_ID:
    4.1 Get list of external networks
    4.2 for each subnet in external network, add 3 ports with one port mapped as network:router_gateway and 2 ports mapped as network:router_ha_gateway for device_id, PHYSICAL_GLOBAL_ROUTER_ID

5. Get list of existing routers

6. For each router that has an interface, get the subnet_id of that port and create two additional ports with device_owner as network:router_ha_interface

7. Update the cisco_phy_router_port_bindings with the port_id(network:router_ha_interface), subnet_id, router_id, and phy_router_id of the physical ASR pair.

8. Stop neutron services.

9. Install the neutron code for Cisco RouterPlugin from onecloud neutron repository(branch/icehouse-reorg) and configure neutron.

10. start the CiscoCfgAgent service and neutron services(except, neutron-l3-agent).
